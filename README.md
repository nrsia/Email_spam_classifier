# Email_spam_classifier
## Overview:
This GitHub repository hosts a spam email classifier system implemented using machine learning techniques in Python. The system is designed to automatically detect and filter out spam emails from a user's inbox, enhancing email security and efficiency.
## Features:
Utilizes supervised learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines to classify emails as spam or non-spam.
Processes email content, sender information, and metadata to extract relevant features for classification.
Implements word embedding techniques to convert email text into numerical vectors for machine learning model input.
Provides accurate and efficient spam detection to protect users from phishing attempts and unwanted emails.
## Technologies Used:
Python for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model implementation.
Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries for text processing and feature extraction.
Flask for creating a user-friendly web interface for testing the spam classifier.
## How to Use:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
Train the spam classifier using the provided dataset or your own labeled email data.
Deploy the trained model to classify new incoming emails as spam or non-spam.
Access the web interface to test the classifier with sample emails and observe its performance.
## Future Improvements:
Enhance the classifier's accuracy by experimenting with different algorithms and feature engineering techniques.
Implement real-time email monitoring and classification for continuous protection.
Integrate feedback mechanisms to improve the classifier's performance over time.
## Contribution:
Contributions are encouraged! Fork the repository, make enhancements, and submit pull requests to collaborate on improving the spam email classifier system.
